Ethiopia is one of the world's oldest nations, with a rich and continuous
historical tradition. The Aksumite Empire (c. 1st7th centuries CE) was a major
trading power in the Red Sea and a pioneer Christian kingdom.

Emperor Menelik II (r. 18891913) is renowned for modernizing Ethiopia and for
leading the Ethiopian victory over Italy at the Battle of Adwa in 1896, a
landmark event in African anti-colonial history. Menelik expanded infrastructure,
founded Addis Ababa as the capital, and strengthened Ethiopia's sovereignty.

Haile Selassie I later pursued international diplomacy and modernization, while
the 20th century saw profound political and social transformations that shaped
modern Ethiopia.
