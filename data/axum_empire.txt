The Kingdom of Aksum was one of the great civilizations of the ancient world. 
Located in present-day northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, Aksum thrived from around the 1st to the 7th century AD.

Aksum was a major trading empire, connecting Africa with the Mediterranean and Asia. 
It exported ivory, gold, and frankincense, and imported silk and spices.

Aksum is also famous for its monumental obelisks, such as the Obelisk of Axum, carved from a single piece of granite.

The kingdom adopted Christianity in the 4th century under King Ezana, making Ethiopia one of the earliest nations to embrace the religion officially.

The Ge'ez script, still used in Ethiopian liturgy today, developed in Aksum during this era.

Although Aksum eventually declined due to environmental changes and shifting trade routes, its legacy continues to influence Ethiopian culture, religion, and identity.
